<h3> Project Description: Biography of Dead Objects </h3>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p>During term2 of our MDEF program, each of us has experienced a range of emotions within our design process. At times we have felt hope and excitement and at times frustration and failure. Within this journey, many ideas and things have been created and many have been laid to death.

We want to open up the “black box” of our design processes, and gather these moments which we consider failures and mistakes. By collecting the “dead” artifacts, the ones that did not make it alive, from individual processes, we hope to explore the connections between these objects and generate new narratives. Through these new narratives, we aim to open up an alternative understanding of failure within the design process and expose the power of the collective.

In the coming design dialogues, we aim to investigate death, failure, and vulnerability within the design process and how these individual moments can collectively be brought to life to create new and collective emergent narratives.

As designers, we usually present only the final outcomes of our designs to the public, while the process tends to stay hidden in the “black box”.

In a way, we want to think about what can emerge from the connections of our collective “dead” ideas?

<h3> Brainstorming:</h3>

</p>
<p>We used the Venn Diagram format to fill out our personal interests and then added our intersecting interests between the group. It was interesting to see how the other team members describe the common theme in relation to their personal interests. The recurring theme within the group were collective biographies, new narratives and culture.</p>

<p>It was a bit challenging at think of concepts which could be made tangible with the abstract keywords we chose to work with. We had to find a middle ground between defamiliarising the object but the stories relatable for everyone too.</p>

<p>To start off with, we asked our classmates to get one object that is (or was) significant for their design process, it could be whatever: a tool, a drawing, a prototype, a failure or anything else.</p>

<h3>Plan and Execution of the Project: </h3>
<p>Before going into the form and technical details, we wanted the idea to be clear and to make sure all of us are on the same page, we decided to keep the first day (Monday) to think about what kind of possibilities could emerge with these "dead" objects. </p>

<p>While discussing our idea with Kate, we realised to "display" our idea it was quite important to keep two things in mind: the interaction of the people with objects (how would they hold it intuitively and not to interfere with their movements) and to keep the presentation of the objects and the speaker appealing.</p>

<p>Images of different forms for the base (horizontal circle, vertical display, objects in a black box, octopus)</p>

<p>Various ways of making the object conductive </p>

<p>The concept of generating a haiku (segments of each sentence told by the person who contributed the object) by touching each object </p>

<h3> Step by Step Fabrication </h3>
<h4> CNC Mill Process </h4>

</p>
<li> As we were clear on cutting the plywood for the base. We sketched it on Rhino and used Rhino Cam plugin to convert it into the code.
</li>

</p>

<li>To fit the 2 sets of elevated planks, we made the structure into dog-bone shaped-joinery. We left an edge of 0.2 mm for the material that gets cut during the mill process
</li>
<li>During the process we also learnt that the depth the CNC can cut in is in proportion the diameter of the mill. (for example the diameter was 6mm, so the maximum depth the wood would be cut in one go will be approx 3mm)
</li>

</p>

<li>While preparing the file for g-code, we made it into two layers. One for screws and then the other layer had pocketing and cut together in the required order
</li>
<li>Feed and Speed parameters: RPM: 21000, Feed Rate: 3800
</li>
<li>The pocketing moves from inside wheres profiling (cutting) works from the outside.
</li>
<li>We exported the file in Post processor output format.
</li>
<li>After the cnc cut was done, with the help of hammer and nail we removed the bridges we attached for the small pieces (elevator planks) in order to prevent them for flying while getting cut.

</p>
<li>Before setting up, we took different grains of sandpaper to take off the splinters.</li>

<h4> Vinyl Cutting, Soldering and Heat Shrink </h4>
<li>To make sure the object "talks" when someone touches it means that circuit needs to be closed at this point of time till the contact is maintained.
<li>To do so, we used copper sheet as it is a conductive material (circle shaped) and attached it to the objects. When the ground (negative) and input pin connection (positive) are touched together the circuit is closed. If not, my default it's open.
</li>
<li>We cut 10 mm diameter circles for the small objects and 20mm diameter for the bigger ones with vinyl cutter via the Silhoutte Software.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/vinylcut.png" width="250" />
  <img src="/images/solder.png" width="250" />
</p>
<li>After cutting the circles, we soldered the wiring endings (total 18 in number- 9 ground pins and 9 input pins) with the soldering wire to make sure the connections remain intact
<li> To make sure the wires stay in place and don't look too messy, we heat shrunk plastic tubes onto each pair.

<h4> Setting Up </h4>

</p>

<h4>Wiring</h4>
<li> Our next step in the process was to connect the black and white wires that were extended from the object to connect it to the Makey Makey which was behind the board.
<li> Wiring multiple objects with their recording and pin was honestly a task to avoid tangling of wires. We stripped the wires off to roll all the ground wires together and then clipped it.<br>

<h3> Reflection </h3>
We gathered our learnings from the first Micro Challenge and planned to start making early and not overthinking from the beginining. We quickly agreed on foundational decisions about the project and start making from the second day.

Each team member agreed on managing a specific part of the process, for acoountability and clarity. These responsibilites shifted as we worked and we all helped eachother, but it was important to know one person would hold responsibility at the end. At the end of the working day, we wrote down the summary of the tasks done during the day and our to-do lists for the following day.

We wanted to create a meaningful product and experience with technology as a medium, and not use technology for the sake of using it. For this reason, we decided to stick with using Makey Makey, and figure out the other components from there. We managed to distill the design and making process down to its foundation (what was meaningful) and manage our time efficiently.


<h3> Future Developments </h3>
<p>In the future, we would like to go deeper into making the electronic components from scratch. We used makey makey due to time and complexity. After inital consultations with the tutors, we realized that if we built the electronics from scratch, we wouldn't be able to make the piece in time. An additional feature we wanted to add was LED lights which lit up when an object was touched.

We would like to elevate the form of the "object table", and design a surface and legs that would hold the objects and the electronics in place. Also we didn't account for all the cables and wires that would need to live on the bottom of the table. In the future version, we would design a pocketed surface or attachment that would organize and house the cables on the bottom side.

We thought the same platforms can expand and be integrated with different communities in the future. The device can help communities understand the processes of individuals and reveal new narratives and futures for them.</p>
